# Analyzing-Data-Link-and-Network-Layer-Traffic-with-Wireshark
This project focused on analyzing network traffic at the Data Link and Network layers using Wireshark.


The key tasks and outcomes were:


Exploring Wireshark and Capturing Traffic: Packets were captured, and a screen capture was provided to show the captured packets.


Pinging and Packet Analysis: A ping test was performed to the IP address 170.30.0.10, and the results were captured. A screen capture of the packet details related to time was also provided.




ARP Table Analysis: The ARP table for the vWorkstation was captured and analyzed. This included capturing the ARP table, clearing it, and then showing the updated table with a new entry for 172.30.0.10 after a ping.




Packet Filtering and Analysis: ARP packets were filtered and a screen capture of the filtered packets was provided. The analysis also involved identifying duplicate IP addresses and ARP poisoning events in a packet capture file.
